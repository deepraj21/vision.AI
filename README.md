<h3>vision.AI</h3><p>The ultimate ecosystem of apps, plugins & resources for all creators, powered by artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>In this project, we are building a web application that allows users to upload images and apply various processing techniques using the ClipDrop API. The main features of the application include:<br></p>

<p>1. <i><b>Image Upload</b></i>: Users can upload images in JPEG or JPG format. They have the option to either select an image using the traditional file input or drag and drop the image onto a designated drop zone.<br>

<p>2. <i><b>Processing Options</b></i> The application provides multiple processing options:<br>
                        - Inpainting<br>
                        - Reimagine<br>
                        - Sketch to image<br>
                        - Remove Background<br>
                        - Image upscaling<br>
                        - Text to Image<br>
                        - Portrait Depth Estimation<br>
                        - Portrait Surface Normals<br>

<p>3. <i><b>API Integration</b></i>: The application uses the ClipDrop API to perform image processing tasks. It communicates with the API to send images, receive processed images, and handle errors.<br>

<p>4. <i><b>Displaying Results</b></i>: After processing an image, the application displays the processed result on the same page. Users can see the depth map, normal map, or text-generated image depending on the processing option chosen.<br>

<p>5. <i><b>Styling and Layout</b></i>: The user interface is designed with a modern an user-friendly approach. It incorporates responsive design using Bootstrap, ensuring that the application looks good and functions well
on various screen sizes.<br>

<p>6. <i><b>Error Handling</b></i>: The application handles errors that may occur during image processing or API interactions, providing feedback to the user if something goes wrong.<br>

<p>7. <i><b>File Management</b></i>: The uploaded images and processed results are saved in the `static` folder of the application, allowing users to download them.<br>

<p>By combining Flask for backend functionality, HTML for front-end structure, and CSS for styling,we create a complete web application that offers image processing capabilities through the ClipDrop API. Users can
easily upload images,choose processing options, view results, and download the processed images.</p><br>
